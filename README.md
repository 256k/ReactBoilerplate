React App Boilerlate:
=====================

This is a basic boilerplate for react apps created following the Udemy course on react.

this boilerplate uses:
1. Webpack to bundle all the javascript modules together.
2. Express to create a local server.
3. Babel to transpile all of our jsx and ES2015 syntax into standard js code.

this boilerplate will surely extend throughout the course.
